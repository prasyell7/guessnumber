# GuessNumberGame
This program uses binary search to guess the number user has imagined. All the messages can be customized accordingly. Lower and Upper limits for the game are customizable. 
When the user types "ready" and enters, the game will start and it continues based on user's response (e.g. lower, higher, yes).

Clone the project and run "mvn package" command to build the project
run the game with the following command

java -cp target\guessnumber-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.math.game.guessnumber.GuessNumberGame
